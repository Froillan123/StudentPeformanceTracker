# Student Enrollment and Grading System Implementation - COMPLETE

## Overview
Successfully implemented a complete enrollment and grading system that connects TeacherSubject, SectionSubject, EDP codes, student enrollment, and grade management functionality.

## Implementation Summary

### Phase 1: Admin Enrollment Management ✅

#### Backend API
- **Enhanced `StudentSubjectRepository.cs`:**
  - Updated `GetByStudentIdAsync` to include all navigation properties (Subject, Section, Teacher, Enrollment)
  
#### Admin Frontend
- **Created `Pages/Admin/EnrollmentManage.cshtml` + `.cs`:**
  - Complete enrollment management interface
  - View all enrollments with student info, course, year level, semester, status
  - Create Enrollment modal with dynamic dropdowns:
    - Student selection (from `/api/v1/student`)
    - Course, Year Level, Semester selection
    - Enrollment Type (Regular/Irregular)
    - School Year input
  - Edit enrollment status (Active/Completed/Dropped/Pending)
  - Delete enrollments
  - Full CRUD operations using existing `/api/v1/enrollment` endpoints

- **Updated `Pages/Admin/Shared/_AdminNavigation.cshtml`:**
  - Added "Enrollments" menu item between "Sections" and "Departments"

### Phase 2: Student EDP Code Enrollment ✅

#### Backend API
- **Created `Controllers/StudentSubjectController.cs`:**
  - `GET /api/v1/studentsubject/student/{studentId}/enrolled` - Get all enrolled classes for a student

    - EDP code validity
    - Duplicate enrollment check
    - Active enrollment requirement
    - Course, year level, and semester matching
    - Capacity limits
    - Automatic enrollment count increment
  - `DELETE /api/v1/studentsubject/{id}` - Drop class (decrement enrollment count)
  - `GET /api/v1/studentsubject/sectionsubject/{sectionSubjectId}` - Get students in a class

- **Enhanced `Controllers/SectionSubjectController.cs`:**
  - `GET /api/v1/sectionsubject/edpcode/{edpCode}` - Find section subject by EDP code

#### Student Frontend
- **Created `Pages/Student/Enrollment.cshtml` + `.cs`:**
  - Beautiful, user-friendly enrollment interface
  - Active enrollment info card (course, year level, semester, school year, status)
  - EDP code enrollment section:
    - Input field with search functionality
    - Real-time class preview before enrolling:
      - Subject, section, teacher

    - Grade display (if available)
    - Drop class functionality
  - Loading and empty states

- **Updated `Pages/Student/MyClasses.cshtml`:**
  - Replaced placeholder data with real API calls
  - Fetches from `/api/v1/studentsubject/student/{studentId}/enrolled`
  - Displays enrolled classes with:
    - Subject name and section
    - Teacher name
    - Schedule and room
    - EDP code
    - Grade (if available)
    - Status badge

- **Updated `Pages/Student/Shared/_StudentNavigation.cshtml`:**
  - Added "Enrollment" menu item between "Dashboard" and "My Classes"

### Phase 3: Teacher Grade Management Interface ✅

#### Grade Management Modals
- **Updated `Pages/Teacher/Grades.cshtml`:**
  - **Add Grade Modal:**
    - Student name display
    - Assessment type dropdown (Quiz, Exam, Project, Assignment, Recitation, Attendance, Practical, Other)
    - Assessment name input
    - Score and max score inputs
    - Auto-calculated percentage
    - Date given picker (defaults to today)
    - Optional remarks
    - Full validation
    - API integration: `POST /api/v1/grade`

  - **View Student Grades Modal:**
    - Student name display
    - Complete grades table with:
      - Date, assessment type, assessment name
      - Score/max score display
      - Percentage
      - Remarks
      - Edit and delete buttons per grade
    - Computed final grade (average percentage)
    - API integration: `GET /api/v1/grade/studentsubject/{studentSubjectId}`

  - **Edit Grade Modal:**
    - Pre-populated form with existing grade data
    - Same fields as add modal
    - Auto-calculated percentage
    - Update functionality
    - API integration: `PUT /api/v1/grade/{id}`

#### JavaScript Functionality
- **Grade Management Functions:**
  - `addGrade(studentSubjectId)` - Opens add grade modal for specific student
  - `viewStudentGrades(studentSubjectId)` - Opens view grades modal with student's grades
  - `submitGrade()` - Creates new grade with validation
  - `loadStudentGrades(studentSubjectId)` - Fetches and displays student grades
  - `openEditGradeModal(gradeId, gradeData)` - Opens edit modal with existing data
  - `updateGrade()` - Updates existing grade
  - `deleteGrade(gradeId, studentSubjectId)` - Deletes grade with confirmation
  - `calculatePercentage()` - Auto-calculates percentage for add form
  - `calculateEditPercentage()` - Auto-calculates percentage for edit form

#### Teacher My Classes
- **No changes needed** - Already loads from `/api/v1/sectionsubject/teacher/{teacherId}` ✓
- Manage Grades button correctly links to Grades page with `sectionSubjectId` parameter

### Phase 4: Bug Fixes and Enhancements ✅

#### Fixed Warning
- **`Controllers/StudentSubjectController.cs`:**
  - Fixed CS8602 null reference warning by using null-forgiving operator (`enrolled!.Id`)

#### JSON Circular Reference Fix
- **`Program.cs`:**
  - Added `ReferenceHandler.IgnoreCycles` to JSON serialization options
  - Added `DefaultIgnoreCondition.WhenWritingNull` for cleaner responses

3. Creates enrollment for student (selects student, course, year level, semester, type, school year)
4. Enrollment is saved with "Active" status
5. Admin can edit status or delete enrollments

### Student Flow
1. Student logs in
2. Navigates to Enrollment page
3. Views active enrollment info (course, year, semester)
4. Enters EDP code from class schedule
5. Reviews class details (subject, teacher, schedule, capacity)
6. Confirms enrollment
7. Class appears in "My Enrolled Classes" and "My Classes" pages
8. Can drop classes if needed
9. Can view grades (when teacher assigns them) in "Grades" page

### Teacher Flow

3. Sees all assigned classes (from TeacherSubject records)
4. Clicks "Manage Grades" for a class
5. Views list of enrolled students (from StudentSubject records)
6. Can add grades for each student:

## Technical Architecture

### Data Flow
```
Admin creates Enrollment
   ↓
Student uses EDP code to enroll → Creates StudentSubject
   ↓
StudentSubject links:
   - Student
   - SectionSubject (which has EDP code)
   - Enrollment
   ↓
Teacher (linked via TeacherSubject) can add Grades
   ↓
Grade records linked to StudentSubject
```

### Validation Chain
1. **EDP Code Enrollment:**
   - Valid EDP code exists
   - Student has active enrollment
   - Enrollment matches section's course, year level, semester
   - Class not full (CurrentEnrollment < MaxStudents)
   - Not already enrolled in same class

2. **Grade Management:**
   - Teacher must be assigned to class (TeacherSubject exists)
   - Student must be enrolled (StudentSubject exists)
   - Score must be valid (0 ≤ score ≤ maxScore)
   - Percentage auto-calculated for accuracy

### Navigation Properties
All key queries include proper navigation properties using `.Include()` and `.ThenInclude()` for:
- Student → Course
- StudentSubject → Student, SectionSubject, Enrollment
- SectionSubject → Section, Subject, Teacher
- Grade → StudentSubject
